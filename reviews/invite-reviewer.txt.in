Hello {{ reviewer }}!

The SciPy 2016 Conference on Python in Science is fast approaching, and so too
is the deadline for Proceedings submissions (May 16th) and consequently the
start of the review process.

We welcome you to be a member of the Proceedings review Committee this year.
This should require a little of your time spread out over the review period
(May 16th to July 4th) to read, comment, and ultimately decide on three
submissions that line up with your area of expertise.

In the spirit of Open Source software, the SciPy conference uses a fully open
and collaborative review process to make proceedings acceptance decisions.  
To learn more about this, you can read about it on the proceedings github page,
https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings.   

Please let us know if you would like to participate this year and we will
include you in subsequent communications.  Also, feel free to pass this message
along to anyone else who may be interested in reviewing.  

Yours Truly, 
Your SciPy 2016 Proceedings co-chairs,
Scott Rostrup and Sebastian Benthall
